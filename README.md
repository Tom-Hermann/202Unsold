# 202unsold

$\frac{(a-x)(b - y)}{(5a −150)(5b −150)}$

With:

- x the price a jacket
- y the price of a trouser
- a and b being integers greater than 50

Let’s call X, Y and Z, respectively, the random variables that represent “the price of a sold jacket”, “the price of sold trousers” and “the price of a sold suit”. Given the values of a and b, the program print:

- an array summing up the joint law of (X, Y), and the marginal laws of X and Y,

- an array summing up the law of Z,

- expected values and variances of X, Y and Z.
